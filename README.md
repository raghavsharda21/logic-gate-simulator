# Logic Gate Simulator (C++)

A simple C++ program that simulates basic digital logic gates.
The user selects a logic gate, enters binary inputs (0 or 1),
and the program displays the corresponding output.

## Logic Gates Implemented
- AND
- OR
- NOT
- NAND
- NOR
- XOR
- XNOR

## Features
- Menu-driven logic gate selection
- User-input based simulation
- Input validation for binary values
- Modular code using functions

## How to Run
Compile the program using a C++ compiler and run the executable.
